    Users
    
In the customers' page the data name, code and address are delivered through an XML Http Request. No interaction can be made with this page

In the products' page the data code and description are delivered through another XML Http Request. The user can select <u>only one</u> product and delete it by pressing the delete button on the top of the screen. The chosen product is being deleted and the list of products is rerendered with the deleted product missing. If more than one products are checked an alert modal will appear.
